However, it does not rule out all conditions, especially those that may not be visible on this specific imaging modality (e.g., soft tissue injuries on X-ray).<br><br>"
        "<strong>Next Steps:</strong><br>"
        "Regular follow-up is recommended as per standard medical guidelines. If symptoms persist despite a normal scan, consult your physician for further evaluation or alternative imaging methods."

        "Opacities in the lungs can be caused by pneumonia, atelectasis (collapsed lung), or neoplasms. In other tissues, masses may be benign (cysts, fibromas) or malignant.<br><br>"
        "<strong>Potential Causes:</strong><br>"
        "<ul><li>Infection (Pneumonia, Abscess)</li><li>Benign Growth (Cyst, Nodule)</li><li>Malignancy (Tumor)</li><li>Scar Tissue</li></ul>"
        "<strong>Next Steps:</strong><br>"
        "Further evaluation with higher-resolution imaging (such as CT with contrast) is strongly recommended to characterize the shape, size, and borders of the opacity. A biopsy may be necessary if malignancy is suspected."
    ),
    "Calcification Detected": (
        "<strong>Condition:</strong> Calcification Detected<br>"

        "<strong>Clinical Context:</strong><br>"

        "<ul><li>Vascular Calcification (Aging, Diabetes)</li><li>Healed Infection (TB, Histoplasmosis)</li><li>Benign Bone Islands</li><li>Calculi (Stones in Kidney/Gallbladder)</li></ul>"
        "<strong>Next Steps:</strong><br>"

        "<strong>Next Steps:</strong><br>"
        "Identify the underlying cause. Diuretics may be used for heart failure, or drainage (thoracentesis/aspiration) may be required for large effusions to analyze the fluid and relieve pressure."

    "Foreign Body Detected": (
        "<strong>Condition:</strong> Foreign Body Detected<br>"
        "A distinct object that is not native to the body has been identified. It appears radio-opaque (bright white) on X-rays.<br><br>"
        "<strong>Clinical Context:</strong><br>"
        "This could be medical hardware (pacemaker, clips), a swallowed object (coin, battery), or a result of penetrating trauma (glass, metal fragment).<br><br>"
        "<strong>Next Steps:</strong><br>"
        "Verify history: Is this known medical hardware? If recent trauma or ingestion, removal may be necessary depending on location and material."
    ),
    "Post-surgical Changes": (
        "<strong>Condition:</strong> Post-surgical Changes<br>"
        "The scan shows evidence of prior surgical intervention. This may include metallic hardware (screws, plates), clips, sutures, or altered anatomy.<br><br>"
        "<strong>Clinical Context:</strong><br>"
        "This is a descriptive finding. The key is to verify if the hardware is intact and in proper position, and that there are no complications like loosening or infection.<br><br>"
        "<strong>Next Steps:</strong><br>"
        "Routine monitoring. If pain is present at the surgical site, evaluation for hardware failure or infection is warranted."
    ),
    "Lymph Node Enlargement": (
        "<strong>Condition:</strong> Lymphadenopathy (Enlarged Lymph Nodes)<br>"
        "Lymph nodes in the scanned region appear larger than normal. This is often a sign that the immune system is active.<br><br>"

        "<ul><li>Infection (local or systemic)</li><li>Inflammation</li><li>Malignancy (Lymphoma or metastatic cancer)</li></ul>"
        "<strong>Next Steps:</strong><br>"
        "Don't panic—infection is the most common cause. However, persistent enlargement requires follow-up. A biopsy may be performed if malignancy is suspected."

        "An organ (such as the heart, liver, or spleen) appears larger than expected dimensions.<br><br>"
        "<strong>Clinical Context:</strong><br>"

        "<strong>Next Steps:</strong><br>"
        "Evaluate function of the specific organ involved (Echocardiogram for heart; LFTs/Ultrasound for liver). Treat the underlying cause."
    ),
    "Bone Density Variation": (
        "<strong>Condition:</strong> Bone Density Variation<br>"
